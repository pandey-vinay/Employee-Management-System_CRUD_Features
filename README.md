# CRUD features for Employee Management System.
These features are created by using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf & Spring JPA Hibernate.

# For UI, I have used Thymeleaf in this Project.
I have added 5 templates like login, user register, save new employee, update an existing employee & employee list.

# For backend, I have used Spring Boot and JPA Hibernate(for saving data in the memory).

I have created 5 apis in this Employee Management System Project :-

1. Save new Employee details.
2. Update existing Employee details.
3. Delete Employee details by Id.
4. List an Employee (With pagination).
5. Get Employee.

Added more functionalities like user register, user login and logout page.
